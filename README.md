# Moving Castles
Moving Castles aims to be a unique roguelike that combines the strategic development (and yes, movement) of a castle, with dungeon-crawls and traditional grid-based combat. My hope would be to strike the right balance between story and strategy, difficulty and approachability.

It's currently a hobby project in pre-alpha state.

Check out the pre-alpha binaries here or on [Itch.io](https://epigone.itch.io/moving-castles).

Two great open-source projects provided the launchpad for this game:
[GoRogue](https://github.com/Chris3606/GoRogue) - suite of tools for tile-based games. Maps, entities, components, map generation, pathfinding, etc.
[SadConsole](https://github.com/SadConsole/SadConsole) - console emulation with a ton of nice features like custom font/tile support and GUI controls.
